# Production Readiness

`Decisions4s` is considered production-ready for **application usage**.

* All functionalities are thoroughly tested and safe for integration into your codebase.
    * The library is intentionally designed with a small, deterministic surface area to minimize complexity.
* **Backward-compatibility guarantees** are not provided for the `0.x` series.
    * We aim to maintain source compatibility on a best-effort basis, using deprecations where possible. However, we reserve the right to make breaking changes to the API if necessary.
    * Binary compatibility is not guaranteed at this stage, meaning we do not recommend building _libraries_ based on `Decisions4s`. This limitation does not affect _application_ use cases.
* Version `0.1.0` will be released following the first confirmed production deployment.
    * Versions in the `0.0.x` series may undergo significant changes and should be considered experimental.
