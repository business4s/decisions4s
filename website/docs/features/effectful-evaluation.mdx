# Effectful Evaluation

`Decisions4s` allows evaluating a decision based on effectful inputs, e.g., when network call is required for a
particular piece of data.

* Inputs will be executed at most once (memoized).
* Inputs will be executed _only_ if required by the rule.
* Input is considered not required if `catchAll` expression is used for matching.
* Table needs to use `HitPolicy.First` because it's the only one for which lazy evaluation can be expected.

To use that feature, add an additional dependency.

import SbtDependency from '@site/src/components/SbtDependency';

<SbtDependency moduleName={"decisions4s-cats-effect"}/>

```scala file=./main/scala/decisions4s/example/docs/EffectfulEvalExample.scala start=start_effect end=end_effect
```

## Other Effect Systems

As of now only `cats-effect` is supported, but the same can be achieved for any other effect system or even `() => T`.
If you want to give it a try and need assistance, please reach out on [Discord](https://bit.ly/business4s-discord).
