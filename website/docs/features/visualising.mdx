# Visualisations

Providing a visual representation of decision logic is a core concern of Decisions4s.
Below we present the available ways of generating such representation.

## Markdown

Markdown representation is provided out-of-the box in the core module.

```scala file=./main/scala/decisions4s/example/docs/RenderingExample.scala start=start_markdown end=end_markdown
```

## Decision Model and Notation (DMN)

[DMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Model_and_Notation) model can be generated using the following dependency:

import SbtDependency from '@site/src/components/SbtDependency';

<SbtDependency moduleName="decisions4s-dmn"/>

```scala file=./main/scala/decisions4s/example/docs/RenderingExample.scala start=start_dmn_raw end=end_dmn_raw
```

## DMN As Image

DMN is an XML file that is not human-friendly without a way to render it.
Decisions4s comes with an additional utility that allows converting the DMN into an image through [dmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js) library.
:::warning
Rendering the image involves running a web browser through [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and capturing screenshots from there.
By default, the assumed browser is Chrome and so [ChromeDriver](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver) needs to be installed.

This process is rather slow and not recommended for live server-side usage.

<SbtDependency moduleName="decisions4s-dmn-to-image"/>

```scala file=./main/scala/decisions4s/example/docs/RenderingExample.scala start=start_dmn_image end=end_dmn_image
```

## Alternative Visualizations

It's possible to convert `DecisionTable`s into other formats, e.g., csv file or alternative markdown representations.
Users are encouraged
to write their own representations
using `decisions4s.internal.RenderUtils.prepare`
that converts a decision table to a structured format ready for further customizations.
