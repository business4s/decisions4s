# Visualisation

Providing a visual representation of decision logic is a core concern of Decisions4s.
See below for the available ways of getting such representation.

## Generating DMN Model

DMN model can be generated using the following dependency:

import SbtDependency from '@site/src/components/SbtDependency';

<SbtDependency moduleName="decisions4s-dmn"/>

:::info
As of now, rendering relies on [camunda-dmn-model](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/tree/master/model-api/dmn-model)
and exposes this dependency directly in the API.
This might change in the near future.
:::

```scala file=./main/scala/decisions4s/example/docs/DmnRenderingExample.scala start=start_dmn_raw end=end_dmn_raw
```

## Rendering DMN Model As Image

DMN is an xml file that is not human-friendly without a way to render it.
Decisions4s comes with additional utility
that allows to convert the dmn into an image through [dmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/dmn-js) library.
:::warning
Rendering the image involves running a web browser through [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and capturing screenshots from there.
By default, the assumed browser is Chrome and so [ChromeDriver](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver) needs to be installed.

This process is rather slow and not recommended for live server-side usage.
:::

<SbtDependency moduleName="decisions4s-dmn-to-image"/>

```scala file=./main/scala/decisions4s/example/docs/DmnRenderingExample.scala start=start_dmn_image end=end_dmn_image
```

## Alternative Visualizations

It's fully possible to convert a `DecisionTable` into markdown or csv file.
This is not provided out of the box, but please reach out if you think it should be.
