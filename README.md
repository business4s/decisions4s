This repository contains a prototype of library helping in expressing business rules. It can be seen as an alternative
to Rules Engines or DMN.

The approach taken relies on higher-order data and follows DMN evaluation model, where each decision has specific
input & output types and consists of a set of rules that match on the input and produce the output.
